        <h2>THE CAMINO JOURNEY</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="intro">The Camino is a trifecta of challenges that awaken the body, the mind and the spirit, so that who we were at the start of the journey is left in the dust as we become who we truly are and are truly meant to be at journey’s end. By sharing my Camino journey with you, how it helped me grow, the lessons and the revelations I had while biking from St-Jean Pied de Port to Santiago de Compostela, I hope that you will begin to see the awesome expanse of what’s possible for yourself. I have been lucky enough to do this journey three times, each time opening myself up to different experiences and learning something new. I want people to know that it’s not impossible to have the life they want. It is so wonderfully, excitingly possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        To help. To inspire, motivate and support people. To show them that they are far more capable than they think they are. Sometimes we do things because they’re expected of us or behave in a certain way because we don’t know any other way. We are always learning about the world as much we are learning about ourselves. We are something to discover. We are each a journey; a pilgrimage. There are profound destinations and valuable treasures inside all of us, waiting to be uncovered. And we are worthy of self-discovery. We are limited only by our beliefs. Where you are now doesn’t determine who you are. Neither does your past. The roles you play, titles you carry and adjectives you use to describe yourself are only a reflection of the limited beliefs you hang onto. For all of us, it is what we do next that determines who we are. We are powerful beyond belief.  We are stories waiting to be written. The forum may be the ideal place for people to share these stories in their own time and to encourage patience amongst the ‘newbies’ in advance of their first experience. It’s not always about the destination as opposed to the journey; the people, places, and experiences of that time and the exact day you are living/ walking.</p>

        <p class="intro"> In 2016, I had a deep sense of need. A need to get away. To step outside life as I knew it. That need is what drove me to embark on the pilgrimage that is the Camino de Santiago. It was challenging on every level; physically, psychologically and spiritually. As I was running away from one thing, I discovered something else, something that changed the way I will forever look at all things.</p>

      <p class="intro"> What can you do today to come more alive in all your tomorrows, no matter what?
      Have you ever felt that what you do is a reflection of what you’ve been taught and not a true reflection of who you are?
      <br>
      <br>
      Have you ever felt that you’ve fast-forwarded through life or have lived it on autopilot, just doing what’s expected of you?


      Trek along with Tarek on his pilgrimage of physical and emotional endurance, of blistered feet and broken bikes, of the meeting of unlikely souls and the generosity of some inspiring people he met along the way.
      </p>
      <h2>The Camino Within</h2>
      <p class="intro">
      In The Camino Within, Tarek Riman will take you on an adventure through 500 miles of the Camino leading you to many insightful revelations he picked up along the way and brought home with him to stay.

      Tarek will inspire you to intentionally and actively reflect on the stories you tell yourself so you can take your own personal Camino Within. <br>He did this work by literally leaving everything behind; comfort, material possessions, technology, employment and important relationships! By breaking out of convention he contributed to his own personal growth, he’s able to provide key takeaways in every chapter to help inspire you to face your own personal challenges and aspirations.
      <br><br>
      The Camino Within promises readers an engaging read that can give rise to adventures of the soul and a meaningful life.

      The book will help you, question your beliefs to understand once and for all, if they are truly yours, see how powerful and cleansing such a journey can be, and begin to uncover your own deep truths and lead you to discover who you truly are.
